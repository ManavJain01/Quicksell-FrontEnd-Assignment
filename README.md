## Quicksell FrontEnd Assignment :: October 2024

For your Quicksell frontend assignment, you're tasked with building a Kanban board application using React JS that interacts with the provided Quicksell API. The key requirements are:

The Kanban board should adjust dynamically based on the user's grouping selection.

Grouping options include:

By Status: Tickets are grouped by their current status.
By User: Tickets are arranged by the assigned user.
By Priority: Tickets are grouped by priority levels.
Sorting options include:

By Priority: Tickets are sorted in descending order based on priority.
By Title: Tickets are sorted in ascending order by their title.
A "display" button should allow the user to choose the desired grouping, and the board should update dynamically based on this input.
